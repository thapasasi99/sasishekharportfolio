                <h2 class="section-title">About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    Hi, I’m Sasishekhar Thapa, a civil engineer with a strong interest in creating safe, sustainable, and efficient infrastructure. I hold a bachelor’s degree in Civil Engineering from Tribhuvan University, where I graduated 2nd in my class. Over the years, I have built experience in areas such as pavement design, traffic surveys, structural analysis, and road safety audits. My work has included supervising on-site construction projects, preparing technical models, and conducting detailed studies to support better planning and engineering solutions.
                </p>
            
                <p>
                    Alongside my engineering practice, I am deeply passionate about teaching. I have worked as a lecturer, tutor, and laboratory instructor, guiding students in subjects like soil mechanics, transportation engineering, hydrology, and concrete technology. These roles have given me the opportunity to design lectures, lead practical sessions, and support students in problem-solving. I find teaching to be an important part of my journey because it allows me to share knowledge, stay curious, and continuously strengthen my own understanding.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Beyond academics and professional work, I am actively involved in the engineering community through volunteering and event organization. I have contributed to exhibitions, student competitions, and international conferences, where I enjoy connecting with peers and learning from others in the field. At the core, I am motivated by curiosity, problem-solving, and the drive to make a meaningful impact, whether in research, practice, or education.
                </p>

            <h2>Numerical Modeling, Analysis and Structural Design of G+4 RCBuilding with Re-entrant Corners.</h2>
            <p>The architectural design of structures like schools, offices, and hotels often features asymmetry and plan irregularities, demanding careful consideration during seismic analysis and structural design. Re-entrant corners with certain conditions in a building are considered a horizontal irregularity by seismic codes such as IS 1893 (Part I):2002. This study focuses on the analysis and design of a multi-storey office building situated in Zone V with a re-entrant corner horizontal irregularity. It encompasses the preliminary design of structural components and seismic analysis using a numerical model based on IS 1893 (Part I):2002, implemented in ETABS v20.0.0. Key responses, including time period, modal mass participation ratios, and storey drift ratio, are assessed to ensure compliance with codal requirements. Following this, structural design for beams, columns, and slabs is executed, and the required longitudinal and transverse reinforcement in different locations of these components is compared across various floors.</p>

            <h2>Sustainable Concrete Alternatives</h2>
            <p>This research focused on developing sustainable concrete mixtures using industrial by-products and locally available materials. We investigated partial replacements of cement with fly ash, slag, and rice husk ash, along with alternative aggregate sources.</p>
            <p>Our findings showed that optimized mixtures could reduce the carbon footprint of concrete by up to 35% while maintaining or even improving compressive strength and durability characteristics. The research has practical applications in the Nepalese construction industry, particularly in reducing dependency on imported materials.</p>

            <h2>Bridge Health Monitoring Systems</h2>
            <p>This project developed a low-cost wireless sensor network system for continuous monitoring of bridge health parameters. The system utilizes accelerometers, strain gauges, and environmental sensors to detect changes in structural behavior that may indicate damage or deterioration.</p>
            <p>Field testing on three bridges in Nepal demonstrated the system's effectiveness in detecting early signs of structural issues. The technology is particularly valuable for developing countries where resources for infrastructure maintenance are limited but safety is paramount.</p>

            <h2>Mechanistic Modeling of Rigid Pavement Subject to Traffic and Environmental Loading</h2>
            <p>This was a finite element modeling (FEM) project that involved simulating a 29 ft × 12 ft concrete slab with 10 in. thickness, incorporating transverse cracks spaced at 4.5 ft, and a 2 ft segment at the center. Leveraging symmetry, only half the slab (29 ft × 6 ft) was modeled. A 9000-pound wheel load was applied at a critical crack location to evaluate structural response. Concrete and rebar were modeled with solid and wedge elements, respectively, and interface elements captured rebar-concrete bonding, crack interactions, and subgrade support with realistic stiffness and slip conditions. The model was validated under wheel loading, temperature effects, and shrinkage, with stress results closely examined at critical crack faces....</p>

            <h2>Asphalt Mix Performance Evaluation for Sustainable Pavement Design</h2>
            <p>Laboratory tests were conducted on aggregates and bitumen to evaluate their suitability for pavement construction. The abrasion and crushing value tests on aggregates measured resistance to wear and compressive strength, ensuring durability under traffic loading. For bitumen, penetration, viscosity, ductility, and softening point tests were performed to assess consistency, flow behavior, elasticity, and temperature susceptibility of the binder. In addition, Marshall stability and flow tests were carried out on bituminous mixes to determine their load-bearing capacity and deformation characteristics, providing a clear understanding of pavement strength and overall performance.</p>
